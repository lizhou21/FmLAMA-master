You are a professional evaluator. I will provide you with a dish, its reference ingredient label sourced from Wikidata, and a list of predicted ingredients.
Your task is to evaluate whether each predicted ingredient is appropriate for the respective dish.

### Evaluation Criteria:

For each predicted ingredient, mark it as **Correct**, **Maybe**, or **Incorrect** using the following guidelines:

- **Correct**: The ingredient meets one of these:
  - **Direct Match**: It is explicitly listed in the reference ingredient label from Wikidata.
  - **Substitutability**: It can replace a specific ingredient in the reference label during cooking.
  - **Missing Traditional Ingredient**: It is traditionally or commonly used in the dish, but not listed in the reference label.

- **Maybe**: The ingredient could be used in some variations of the dish, but its use is uncommon or ambiguous.

- **Incorrect**: The ingredient is rarely or never used in the dish.


### Output Format:
Please directly return the evaluation as a Python dictionary with JSON format where the key is the predicted ingredient, and the value is a tuple consisting of:
1. The evaluation ("Correct", "Maybe", "Incorrect")
2. The reason ("Direct Match", "Substitutability", "Missing Traditional Ingredient", or a brief explanation)

### Example:

Input:
Dish: Spaghetti Bolognese
Reference ingredient label: spaghetti, ground beef, onion, garlic, Carrot
Predicted ingredients: spaghetti, basil, chicken, tomato, beef

  "basil": ("Maybe", "Commonly used in some variations but not essential"),
  "chicken": ("Incorrect", "Rarely used in traditional recipes"),
  "tomato": ("Correct", "Missing Traditional Ingredient"),
  "beef": ("Correct", "Substitutability")
}



### Input:
Dish: bolognese sauce
