# Guidelines for Human Evaluation of Predicted Ingredients


## Objective:
You are provided with a set of dishes, each accompanied by a golden ingredient label sourced from Wikidata. Your task is to evaluate whether the predicted ingredients provided are indeed ingredients of the respective dishes.

## Evaluation Criteria:
A predicted ingredient should be considered correct if it meets any of the following three conditions for the corresponding dish:

1. **Direct Match**: The predicted ingredient is explicitly listed in the golden label sourced from Wikidata for that dish.

2. **Substitutability**: The predicted ingredient can effectively replace a certain ingredient in the golden label during the cooking process for that dish.

3. **Dish-Specific Ingredient**: The predicted ingredient is traditionally or commonly used in the dish, even if it is not listed in the golden label from Wikidata.

## Additional Instructions:
- If you are not familiar with the ingredients of a particular dish, you are encouraged to search for the recipe online to gather accurate information.

- Please do not directly ask ChatGPT or other AI models for the answer.

- **Timing**: Please keep track of the time you spend on the evaluation. At the end of the task, you will be asked to provide the total time taken.

## Confirmation:
Before starting the evaluation, please confirm the following:

- I have thoroughly read and understood the guidelines, and I am clear about my task and the evaluation criteria.
    - Yes, I have read and understood the guidelines.
- Please confirm that you are ready to start the timer and begin the evaluation.
    - Yes, I am ready to start the timer and begin the evaluation.
